          <h2>About Bubble Pop</h2>
          <p>
            My project explores the “No Text Characters” prompt by designing a
            UI that relies on visual and auditory cues. The entire experience is
            built around the concept of bubbles. Each click will generate a
            bubble and a corresponding sound. Upon clicking the generated
            bubbles, the bubbles will pop and, again, generate an appropriate
            sound.
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea was sparked by the image of soap and its transformation
            into bubbles, which naturally suggested an interactive system where
            bubbles could be created and then pop. The design is intended to
            evoke a sense of fun and curiosity, much like blowing bubbles as a
            child.
          </p>

      <!-- Prototype Progress -->

          <h2>Prototype Progress</h2>
          <p>
            The current prototype allows users to generate bubbles by clicking
            anywhere on the screen. Each bubble is created at the cursor’s
            location, assigned a random size, and linked with a random chosen
            musical note. The bubbles float upwards, fade out, and are
            eventually removed from the webpage.
          </p>
          <p>
            At this stage, the interaction is deliberately simple so I could
            test the mechanics of bubble generation, animation, and audio. This
            helped me evaluate whether users would find the floating and fading
            satisfying, or whether a different animation style would be more
            engage (and necessary).
          </p>
          <p>
            The prototype differs from the envisioned final project in several
            key ways: the bubbles do not yet pop when clicked, there is no
            option to reset the canvas, and colours are not yet randomised.
          </p>

          <h2>Visual Style</h2>
          <h3>Modal Popup</h3>
          <p>
            For the modal popup, I decided to reflect the theme visually by
            using a bubble-shaped font and a palette of purple and blue tones.
            These colours echo the way bubbles reflect light, often showing a
            purplish or bluish tint. Although the modal is not central to the
            interaction, keeping this consistent design helps create a cohesive
            first impression.

          <p>
            The visual style was heavily influenced by the Windows 10 bubble
            screensaver, which displays softly glowing bubbles floating against
            a dark background. This inspired my choice of a darker backdrop so
            that the colours and transparency of the bubbles stand out more
            vividly. A dark background also helps emphasise the glowing,
            floating quality I want to capture.

            There are further visual inspirations I want to take into account
            when styling the final product. Of course, I aim to make the sounds
            align with the aesthetics, making it sound light and possibly with a
            hint of sparkliness. I aim to try make the colours a bit more
            diverse so that there is a visual difference for each bubble that is
            generated, to maintain engagement.

            While researching, I explored a range of CSS and JavaScript bubble
            experiments online. This particular website provides a variety of
            approaches to styling bubbles using CSS. I used this as inspiration
            for including an animation and plan to use it as inspiration later
            on for properly styling the bubbles.

          <p>
            Another project I came across was a "bubble wrap" design. This
            particularly stood out to me because it featured bubbles that could
            pop, because it’s based off of bubble wrap. This influenced my
            decision to add the behaviour for my final version. These references
            helped me gain insight that having an extra feature would keep the
            interaction engaging, since endlessly generating and watching
            bubbles could easily become repetitive and boring.

      <!-- Technical Approach -->

        <div class="text">
          <h2>Technical Approach</h2>
          <p>
            I chose randomisation (Math.random()) as my advanced JavaScript
            technique. This technique felt the most natural for bubbles because
            it mirrors the unpredictability of their real-world behaviour.
          </p>
          <p>The technique of randomisation is used in two key ways:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>To vary the size of the bubbles</li>
            <li>To vary the musical notes played</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            This creates a dynamic and engaging interaction where every click
            produces a slightly different visual and audio result. Later on, I
            will be implementing it to vary the colour of the bubbles produced
            as well. The location of the bubble generated will not be randomised
            as I believe it will not be an intuitive way of interacting.

              At first I used this tutorial as a point of reference but as I was
              struggling to understand I sought advice on what would be an
              easier method.

          <!-- <h3>Bubble Generation</h3> -->
          <!-- <p>
            The bubbles are generated using a createElement() function. A new
            element is created and styled via CSS, positioned at the cursor’s
            coordinates. Each bubble is given a randomised size through
            math.random(). Simultaneously, a random index is generated with both
            math.floor and math.random to select a note from an array, in which
            the audio is provided via Tone.js.

          <h3>Feedback and Animation</h3>
          <p>
            The animation is handled though CSS transitions, which allows the
            bubbles to float upward and fade out. After the animation completes,
            a setTimeeout function removes the element from the page. This
            prevents the canvas from being overwhelmed with inactive bubbles,
            but for the final project I intend to keep bubbles onscreen until
            they are interacted with.

            JS is more suited for this purpose.

          <h2>Reflection on Feedback</h2>
          <p>
            I asked 3 questions to evaluate the intuitiveness of the prototype.
            The questions are as following:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Did you understand that clicking anywhere would generate bubbles?
            </li>
            <li>
              Did the look and movement of the bubbles match the sounds they
              made?
            </li>
            <li>
              Was the behaviour of the bubbles what you imagined would happen
              when you clicked?
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Overall, users quickly grasped the main interaction, however, two
            key issues were discovered.
          </p>
          <h3>Sound Design</h3>
          <p>
            Although randomised notes made each bubble unique, some users felt
            the sounds did not match the appearance and behaviour of the
            bubbles. They described the tones as too much like a piano and
            suggested they should sound more “child-like”. Based on this, I plan
            to redesign the audio system so that the sound is linked more
            directly to the bubble’s characteristics. For example, larger
            bubbles will produce lower-pitched sounds and smaller bubbles will
            produce higher-pitched ones. This mapping should feel more intuitive
            and consistent.
          </p>
          <h3>Animation</h3>
          <p>
            Some users enjoyed seeing the bubbles float and fade away, but
            others expected them to pop or bounce around. This feedback
            confirmed my initial suspicion that fading out would not sustain
            engagement. For the final design, I plan to make the bubbles persist
            on the screen until clicked, at which point they will pop with a
            corresponding sound effect. If possible, I will also experiment with
            having the bubbles bounce gently around the screen, which may
            further increase the sense of play.
          </p>
          <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
          <p>
            Through this feedback, I realised that my prototype demonstrated the
            technical feasibility of the idea but still needs further
            refinement. By adjusting the sound design and animation, I can
            better align the user’s expectations with the playful concept of
            bubbles.
